Most of the time you are not thinking 
You are just repeating patterns from your memory. You are just struck in memory 


Most of the time you are not thinking !
You are just struck in your memory. 
How can you innovate. 

When an idea is struck in your mind 
It find place in your memory 
Then the idea becomes a Patterns

Dear Human

You have no Personality
You are a Complex Patterns
Patterns appear to have quasi morals or ethics 

Dear Humans 
You are a Heuristic machine 
Not a quasi-ethics conformist.
 
Fractals do make patterns of life 
But they never repeat in Meanings, Fate and regularities 
You will never be able to understand with a competent Law. 


Laws are not explanations, 
They are regularities of Pattern, 
Patterns may be  But they never repeat the history.



Patterns are bounded by Universe.
Universe has no other choice 
But to create random Patterns.

Random Patterns are have emergent properties 
Emergent properties behold in eyes of beholder.

Random Patterns,Assigned Scientic Laws
May produce Emergent properties 
Coherent with universal laws 
But they all reduce to 
Randomness unexplained, un-understood
